# HOST_OBJS			.ho files from compilation.

#
# Depend: generate dependency information.
# Use gcc's -MM argument for this.
#
# Note that we use -MM rather than -M, so we don't get system headers.
# They would be host system headers and we don't want to get involved
# with those.
#
# The awk scripts and the first sed invocation transform the results to
# have one file per line.
# 
# The second sed command changes the .o filenames in gcc's output
# to .ho names.
#
# The third sed command replaces the value of $(INSTALLTOP) -- which
# is some pathname -- with the string $(INSTALLTOP). This makes the
# depend file independent of the value of $(INSTALLTOP).
#
# XXX: why the $p;$x? That seems like a no-op in this script... also,
# this logic is extremely opaque and could be done a lot better...
