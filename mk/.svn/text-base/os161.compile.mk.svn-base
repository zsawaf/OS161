#
# Depend: generate dependency information.
# Use gcc's -M argument for this.
#
# Note that we use -M rather than -MM, to get both system headers
# and program-local headers. This is because we *are* the system and
# we might well change those system headers.
#
# The awk scripts and the first sed invocation transform the results to
# have one file per line.
# 
# The second sed command replaces the value of $(INSTALLTOP) -- which
# is some pathname -- with the string $(INSTALLTOP). This makes the
# depend file independent of the value of $(INSTALLTOP).
#
# XXX: why the $p;$x? That seems like a no-op in this script... also,
# this logic is extremely opaque and could be done a lot better...
