 * System call dispatcher.
 *
 * A pointer to the trapframe created during exception entry (in
 * exception.S) is passed in.
 *
 * The calling conventions for syscalls are as follows: Like ordinary
 * function calls, the first 4 32-bit arguments are passed in the 4
 * argument registers a0-a3. 64-bit arguments are passed in *aligned*
 * pairs of registers, that is, either a0/a1 or a2/a3. This means that
 * if the first argument is 32-bit and the second is 64-bit, a1 is
 * unused.
 *
 * This much is the same as the calling conventions for ordinary
 * function calls. In addition, the system call number is passed in
 * the v0 register.
 *
 * On successful return, the return value is passed back in the v0
 * register, or v0 and v1 if 64-bit. This is also like an ordinary
 * function call, and additionally the a3 register is also set to 0 to
 * indicate success.
 *
 * On an error return, the error code is passed back in the v0
 * register, and the a3 register is set to 1 to indicate failure.
 * (Userlevel code takes care of storing the error code in errno and
 * returning the value -1 from the actual userlevel syscall function.
 * See src/user/lib/libc/arch/mips/syscalls-mips.S and related files.)
 *
 * Upon syscall return the program counter stored in the trapframe
 * must be incremented by one instruction; otherwise the exception
 * return code will restart the "syscall" instruction and the system
 * call will repeat forever.
 *
 * If you run out of registers (which happens quickly with 64-bit
 * values) further arguments must be fetched from the user-level
 * stack, starting at sp+16 to skip over the slots for the
 * registerized values, with copyin().
